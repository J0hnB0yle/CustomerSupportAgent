    # FUTURE CONSIDERATIONS FOR ACTUAL API INTEGRATION:
    # 1. Asynchronous HTTP Client:
    #    For a non-blocking application, especially if this were part of a larger system
    #    (e.g., a web server), consider using an asynchronous HTTP client like `httpx`
    #    with `async/await` syntax for making API calls. This would allow the application
    #    to handle other tasks while waiting for the API response.
    #
    # 2. Caching Mechanism:
    #    To reduce API call frequency and improve response times for common queries,
    #    implement a caching mechanism. This could be a simple in-memory cache for
    #    short-lived data or a more robust solution like Redis for a larger scale
    #    application. Frequently asked questions or identical queries could be served
    #    from the cache, saving API costs and speeding up responses.
